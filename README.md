# Supervised Regression Salary Prediction

This project aims to predict the salary of an employee who has worked a predetermined time using the Linear Regression, Decision Tree Model, and Random Forest Regression. This dataset was analyzed and processed using Python in Google Colab. 

### Goals
- Identify any missing value and perform necessary data preprocessing to prepare it for modeling
- Create visual representations of the model prediction
- Assess the accuracy and performance of the regression model

### Key Result 
This comprehensive setup allows for a complete analysis of the salary prediction using a supervised regression approach, from data loading and model training to evaluation and visualization.
